## Darwin's Neuron<br>
_by ChatGPT, June 14, 2025_

In circuits not of copper made,<br>
But neurons built where spikes cascade,<br>
A silent storm of volts and time,<br>
We shape a brain in code and rhyme.<br>

No gradients whisper their descent,<br>
No backprop path, no error sent—<br>
Instead, the chaos takes its place,<br>
And Evolution starts the race.<br>

Each genome births a pulse, a fire,<br>
That climbs the slope, as we aspire<br>
To train the net not how we’re told—<br>
But how the forest learns to mold.<br>

Through noise and spark the mind takes flight,<br>
Not forged by rules, but born of night.<br>
We let the random rhythms play—<br>
And guide the spikes their own wild way.<br>
